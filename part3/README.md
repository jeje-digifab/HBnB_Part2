## Installation

Operating system : Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Virtual Environment : hbtn2
Flask : flask_sqlalchemy, flask_migrate, flask_bcrypt, flask_jwt_extended
## Roadmap

Implement JWT authentication to secure your API and manage user sessions.

Enforce role-based access control to restrict access based on user roles (regular users vs. administrators).

Replace in-memory repositories with a SQLite-based persistence layer using SQLAlchemy for development and configure MySQL for production.

Design and visualize a relational database schema using mermaid.js to handle relationships between users, places, reviews, and amenities.

Ensure the backend is secure, scalable, and provides reliable data storage for production environments.
